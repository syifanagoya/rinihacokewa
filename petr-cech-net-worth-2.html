Petr ÄŒech plays for the Oxford City Stars. Formerly, he was a professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper from 1999 to 2019, during which time he helped Chelsea win four Premier League titles, among several other championships. ÄŒech also represented the Czech Republic national football team in various tournaments, becoming the most capped player in the history of the team.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Petr ÄŒech was born on May 20, 1982 in PlzeÅˆ, Czechoslovakia as a triplet alongside sister Å Ã¡rka and brother Michal.</p><h2 id=youth-career><strong>Youth Career</strong></h2><p>When he was seven, ÄŒech began playing football for the local Å koda PlzeÅˆ. He played with the team for a decade before making his senior debut in 1999.</p><h2 id=chmel-blrany-sparta-prague-rennes><strong>Chmel BlÅ¡any, Sparta Prague, and Rennes</strong></h2><p>ÄŒech joined the Czech First League club Chmel BlÅ¡any in mid-1999. He played for the club until 2001, when he joined Sparta Prague. In late 2001, ÄŒech broke the record for the longest time elapsed without conceding a goal in the Czech professional league, at 855 minutes. His record ultimately ended at 903 consecutive minutes. In the summer of 2002, ÄŒech joined the French Ligue 1 club Rennes, with which he played until 2004.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-226598 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Petr-Cech.jpg alt width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-226598 class=wp-caption-text>Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images</p><h2 id=chelsea><strong>Chelsea</strong></h2><p>ÄŒech moved to the English Premier League club Chelsea in 2004. He was an immediate success with the club; in March 2005, he set a Premier League record of 1,025 minutes without conceding a goal. Chelsea went on to win the Premier League title. For keeping a record 24 clean sheets in the 2004-05 season, ÄŒech earned his first Premier League Golden Glove. He continued his success in the 2005-06 season as Chelsea won a second consecutive Premier League title. Early the next season, ÄŒech suffered a near-fatal head injury when he collided with Reading midfielder Stephen Hunt in Chelsea's penalty area. He underwent surgery for a depressed skull fracture and was out of play for about three months. ÄŒech made his return in a loss to Liverpool in January 2007, during which he debuted the rugby-style headguard he would wear for the rest of his career. After that, he resumed his goalkeeping prowess, going around 810 minutes of Premier League play without conceding a goal. With ÄŒech's clean sheet in the 2007 FA Cup final, Chelsea emerged victorious.</p><p>ÄŒech signed a new, five-year contract with Chelsea in the summer of 2008. He ended the 2008-09 season helping the club win another FA Cup. ÄŒech was on top form in the 2009-10 season, keeping 17 clean sheets to help Chelsea claim both the Premier League title and the FA Cup. For the season, he won his second Premier League Golden Glove. ÄŒech sustained his success over the subsequent seasons. In 2011, he won his first Chelsea Player of the Year award, and in 2012 helped Chelsea claim its first Champions League title. ÄŒech subsequently signed a new, four-year contract with the club. He went on to lead Chelsea to a UEFA Europa League title in 2013. In 2014, ÄŒech notched his third Premier League Golden Glove in a joint win with Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech SzczÄ™sny. His final season with Chelsea in 2014-15 was another highlight, as the club won both the Premier League title and the League Cup, the fourth and third of ÄŒech's career, respectively.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-259911 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/GettyImages-482761844.jpg alt width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-259911 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=arsenal><strong>Arsenal</strong></h2><p>In mid-2015, ÄŒech signed a four-year contract with Arsenal.

In the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, ÄŒech helped lead the Czech Republic to its first-ever title at the youth level. After joining the senior team in 2002, he played in the UEFA Euro 2004. ÄŒech later represented his country in the 2006 World Cup and in the Euros 2008 and 2012. In the summer of 2016, he announced his retirement from international football.
