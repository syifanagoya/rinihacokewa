There, he took his first steps towards MMA by becoming a part of the wrestling team.</p><p>After graduation, Benson attended Dana College, where he graduated with a double major in criminal justice and sociology.</p><p>&nbsp;Aside from that, Henderson also became a two time NAIA All-American during his college years.</p><h2>Benson Henderson: Career & Record</h2><p>Benson made his professional debut in 2006 at Midwest Championship Fighting. Moreover, he fought <strong>Dan Gregory,</strong> whom he dispatched easily in the very first round.</p><p>Thereafter, Henderson fought seven more fights in which he managed an impressive seven wins and one loss.</p><p>As a matter of fact, the 36-year-old was on a five-fight winning streak when he joined his first major MMA organization, WEC.</p><p>Subsequently, Benson fought six times in the WEC, where he won the WEC Lightweight Championship.</p><p>Furthermore, Henderson defended his belt twice against <strong>Jamie Varner</strong> and<a href=#> <strong>Donald Cerrone</strong>.</a> However, in his last fight for the promotion, the Colorado native lost Anthony Pettis’s title.</p><p>After that, Benson joined the UFC, where he gained all his fame and wealth that he boasts now. During his time in UFC, Henderson achieved the ultimate feat by becoming the UFC Lightweight Champion.</p><p>Moreover, the 36-year-old defeated one of the world’s best lightweights, <strong>Frankie Edgar,</strong> to win the title.</p><h3>Why did Benson Henderson leave the UFC? Bellator MMA</h3><p>Unfortunately, Benson could hold onto the title for two more fights before losing to his old nemesis, Anthony Pettis, again.</p><p>After that, Henderson fought in six more fights under the UFC banner before deciding to part ways.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Benson-inside-the-ring-e1613111972462-300x172.png><p>Although the exact reasons have not been publicized, many believe it was due to a disagreement over a new contract.</p><p>Consequently, Benson left the UFC and signed with their most fierce competitor, Bellator MMA. At the time of his departure, the Colorado native amassed 11 wins and three losses.</p><h4>Also, check out: <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;&lt;Dan Henderson Bio: Career, Achievements, Net Worth, Record, Wife Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Since then, the fighter has fought in eight bouts, of which five have been victories while the other three have been losses.</p><p>Despite the better win record, one loss that still haunts Henderson is against <strong>Michael Chandler</strong> for the Bellator Lightweight World Championship.</p><h2>How old is Benson Henderson? Age, Weight & Nationality</h2><p>At the moment, Benson is 36 years of age. Likewise, the Colorado native was born on the 16th day of November, which means that he is a Scorpio by horoscope.</p><p>And, while we’re on the subject of Scorpios, they tend to be loyal, ambitious, and secretive, to name a few.</p><p>Moving on, MMA fighters need to constantly keep track of their weight so that they don’t become overweight during the weigh-ins.</p><p>Similarly, Henderson fights in the Lightweight division. As a result, Benson weighs in at 155 lb, which is the maximum limit for a lightweight fighter.</p><p>Furthermore, the fighter&nbsp;stands at 5 feet 9 inches (1.75). And, talking about his nationality, Benson was born in Colorado Springs, located in Colorado. As a result, Henderson is a proud American Citizen.</p><p>Other than that, we also found out that Benson has never touched alcohol or cigarettes his entire life.</p><p>Well, kudos to the former UFC Lightweight Champion for keeping himself a straight edge.</p><h3>Toothpick</h3><p>As we all know, athletes are incredibly superstitious. They have to follow the same routine day in day out. Otherwise, they feel that something is not quite right, which can mess with their heads.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/benson-1124.jpg><p>Likewise, Henderson is no different. The fighter has an extremely unusual habit of chewing on a toothpick during all his fights.</p><p>Yes, you heard it right, the man keeps a sharp pointy object in his mouth while getting punched in his face hundreds of times per match.</p><h3>Benson Henderson | Stat</h3><table class="Table Table--align-right"><tr class="Table__TR Table__even"><th class=Table__TH title=Date>DATE</th><th class="tl Table__TH" title=Opponent>OPPONENT</th><th class="tl Table__TH" title=Res.>RESULT</th><th class="tl Table__TH" title=Decision>DECISION</th><th class=Table__TH title=Rnd>TIME</th><th class=Table__TH title=Time>RND</th><th class="tl Table__TH" title=Event>EVENT</th></tr><tbody class=Table__TBODY readability=27><tr class="Table__TR Table__TR--sm Table__even" data-idx=0 readability=2><td class=Table__TD>Nov 20, 2020</td><td class="tl Table__TD">Jason Jackson</td><td class=Table__TD><p>Loss</p></td><td class="FightHistoryCard__Decision tl Table__TD"><p>Decision – Unanimous</p></td><td class=Table__TD>5:00</td><td class=Table__TD>&nbsp;3</td><td class="FightHistoryCard__Event tl Table__TD">Bellator 253: Caldwell vs. McKee</td></tr><tr class="Table__TR Table__TR--sm Table__even" data-idx=1 readability=2><td class=Table__TD>Aug 8, 2020</td><td class="tl Table__TD">Michael Chandler</td><td class=Table__TD><p>Loss</p></td><td class="FightHistoryCard__Decision tl Table__TD"><p>KO</p></td><td class=Table__TD>2:09</td><td class=Table__TD>&nbsp;1</td><td class="FightHistoryCard__Event tl Table__TD">Bellator 243: Chandler vs. Henderson 2</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Benson Henderson: Net Worth & Fight Purse</h2><p>As of 2023, Henderson has a massive net worth of <strong>$1.5 million</strong> accrued from his career as a professional MMA fighter.</p><p>Moreover, the 36-year-old has been involved in combat sports for nearly 15 years.</p><p>In that time, Benson has earned more than <strong>$2 million</strong>. Hence, his huge cash reserve should not be of any surprise.</p><p>Moving on, Henderson took home <strong>$100,000</strong> as his fight purse after his victory over <strong>Adam Piccolotti</strong> at Bellator 220.</p><p>It is quite astonishing because back when Benson made his debut for WEC in 2009, he took home a measly <strong>$5,000</strong>. On the contrary, the 36-year-old’s biggest payday came during 2013.</p><h3>You might also be interested in: <strong><a href=#>&lt;&lt; Matt Mitrione: Career, Net worth, Wife, Children, MMA & UFC>></a></strong></h3><p>To be precise, Benson headlined the UFC on Fox: Henderson vs. Melendez event.</p><p>Furthermore, Henderson won the fight via a split decision and took home <strong>$200,000,</strong> which included <strong>$100,000 </strong>to show and another <strong>$100,000</strong> for the win.</p><h2>Benson Henderson Personal life | Wife & Kids</h2><p>Talking about his love affair, Benson is happily married to his wife, <strong>Maria Magana.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, the exact details of the genesis of their relationship remains a mystery. Similarly, the information concerning their wedding day has also been kept in the dark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Benson-with-his-wife-300x300.jpg><p>Nevertheless, we found out that the duo has four children. Three sons named <strong>Koah Abram Henderson, Kyong Henderson, Kub Henderson, </strong>and a beautiful daughter named <strong>Knightley Henderson</strong>.</p><p>All in all, the family of six is one of the most closely knitted family one can be.</p><p>Moreover, Benson is a loving husband to his wife and a caring and protective father for their kids. Hence, this duo will definitely stand the test of time and grow old together.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Benson Henderson is quite active in social media and has built a huge social profile.</p><p>Henderson is available on most popular social networking sites like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
